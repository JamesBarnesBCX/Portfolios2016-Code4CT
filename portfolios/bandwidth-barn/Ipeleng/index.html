      <h2 class="heading-style">How I plan to make a difference</h2>
      <p>Before learning to code, I didn't really think of the future or how I plan to make a difference or any kind of future plans, but as I joined Code4CT and seeing these amazing and inspiring people who made a difference, who made a mark for themselves, I too want to be one of these people. I too want to be known for something good that I've done, I too want to make a difference. </p>
      <p>In terms of what i plan to do, I have no idea. I do want to make a difference in the tech industry. I,m still learning to code, I'm a work and i want to progress. I'm still new to this thing. I wanna know my strenghs , my weaknesses , I wanna know what I'm capable of doing </p>
