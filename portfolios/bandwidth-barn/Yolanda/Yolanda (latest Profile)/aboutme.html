    <h2> Changing the world </h2>
    <p> I believe that we were all bought in this world for a purpose. a purpose that is set to change the world.
    I want to change the world in a way that I will be remember everyday. I want to change the world by empowering all the teenagers that feel like giving up.
    The road to success is long and it is not easy, so i want to give them the strength they need to face those challenges. As we all know that being
    a teenager is stressful, you have to avoid many things. There's also a major influence in your life: peer pressure, which you must try and avoid. </p>
