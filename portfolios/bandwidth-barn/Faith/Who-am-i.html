<p>My name is Ayabulela Faith Tamte. I am a 2000's baby. I currently live in a township called Khayelitsha in which I hopefully get out of one day. I go to a school called COSAT, I don't want to brag but it's the best. I have dreams and ambition which I hope to achieve one day, through hard work  ofcourse.  </p>
