      <h1>Who am i and what are my values in life?</h1>

      <p>I'm Nonopha Avela Mamba, a sixteen year old girl doing my high school studies at COSAT high school. Just like every girl i have ambitions and goals but i was very lucky to get a chance to attend Code4CT project and be part of it. My ambitions are to be a rich lady with degrees of being a doctor and a lawyer,I want to travel the world. Code4CT is great platform for me to learn about coding and it basically opens up  doors for me to travel the world. With this type of skill i can do a lot of things that can help people who are suffering and I can make a great change. I learnt so many skills at code camp and being around so many different peopl helped me in boosting my confidence and being used to talking in public ,voicing out my thoughts about any matter at hand.</p>
      <p>Life on it's own needs a person who can manage to be strong and not let anyone pull them down.Focus, determination, faith, hope, love, respect and patiance are good qualities that a girl at my age with such ambitions should have in order to reach their dreams and have the better and bright future they desire.
