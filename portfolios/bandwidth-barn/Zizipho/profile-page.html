  <p>Before joining code4ct I didnt know anything about coding,and when I did I didn't really think of the future or how I plan to make a difference.So as the time went by,I started enjoying coding and became good at CSS.What pushed me to the point of continueing with code4ct,I saw these amazing and inspiring people who made a difference in the world.I too wanted to be one of the people who made a difference, who made a mark for themselves, I too want to be one of these people. I too want to be known for something good that I've done, I too want to make a difference. </p>
  <p>"Coding" means a lot of different things to a lot of different people,and it looks different now from how it used to.And,funnily enough,the tools and packages and framework that make it faster and easier for newcomers or even trained developers to build things are most likely to be tarred with the "not for REAL coders"brush.So what I learned from code4ct is that as you get more comfortable,you'll naturally start to find those tooles limiting rather than helpful and look for more powerful ones.</p>
