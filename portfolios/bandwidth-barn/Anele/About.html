  <h1>Me in a nutshell!!!</h1>
  <h2>I'm just a chilled young lady from Ekasi Yamarhumusha, GUGULETHU</h2>
<p>I grew up in Khayelitsha and did my lower grades at Imperial Primary School from grade1-5 and completed my primary at Lwandle Primary School grades6 and 7. I moved to Gugulethu a year after I had joined the Centre Of Science And Technology and that was 2014. I'm having a chellenging Teenage life just like any normal Teenager but i'm certainly doing something to better my future.</p>
<p>Hala there!!! My name is Anele Sigwili and I attend school at the Centre of Science and Technology.I'm a girl in grade10 and I love coding.</p>
<p>I started coding in the year 2016, firstly I was using delphi because at my school we were using delphi to program. It wasn't much exciting coz
   delphi has limited things you can do in your code, but for me as long as it
    has to do with a computer then I'm cool with everything.</p> <p>I love computers
    my friend yhooo and so because of that a friend of mine told me about CODE4CT.
    I researched about code4ct and what it does basically and I was interested because
     it showed me a different version of coding.</p> <p>JAVASCRIPT!!! What an interesting
     program to work with because it has incredible coding techniques and you can
      be able to style your code. I fell in love with this type of coding and I
      decided to sign up for code4ct and luckily I was accepted.So now I'm a
      developing programer YEYYY...</p>
