      <h2 class="heading-style">How I plan to make a difference</h2>
 </p>before i started coding i wanted to be an enterpreneur and then i changed and wanted to be a charted accounted but then my teacher  suggested that if i first become a charted accounted and then become an nterpreneur because many charted accounent become enterpreneur and they pay they do the charted accountent work them selves . So i plan to make a diference by creating more jobs for the people and also have a sponsoring company that will help students to carry on with their studies and be the future scientinsts, doctors , enterpreneurs etc

      <p>In terms of what i plan to do, I have no idea. I do want to make a difference in the tech industry. I,m still learirning to code and i think i wanna make a difference nationally and internationally by creating jobs and by using technology</p>
