    <h4>Why I'm Here!!</h4>
      <p class="column"> After hearing what Charney and Tracy had to say about Code4CT and everything they do I couldn't help but get super excited
         about the opportunity. I've always had an interest in programming and coding. In grade 9
         I took a extra IT course and although it was very difficult it was very rewarding.  Unfortunately because I was
         struggling with some subjects and transport was a big problem I was unable to continue with those amazing sessions as
         they were after school and the homework was challenging especially since I had no</p>

          <p class="column"> access to a home computer resulting in me having to stay after school to complete them.I am really passionate about giving back to my community
         and after hearing about the amazing app that they have created I was truly inspired. I would love to have this
         opportunity to try and work for a better tomorrow because the main thing that the innovation camp
         (with innovate the Cape) taught me was that I make a difference and I'm an innovator. And I feel that by being apart of something
         as wonderful as Code4CT is an excellent start </p>
