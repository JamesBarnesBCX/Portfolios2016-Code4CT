  <h2>Students For A Better Future</h2>
  <p>
    Students For A Better Future is a scholarship progamme for the
    academically gifted and financially needy. But over the course of
    the 3 years that I've been with SBF it has shown me  that it's not
    just a scholarship programme but a family and I've had the utmost
    pleasure to be apart of this family and meeting the wonderful people within
    it.

  <h2>Outreach Work</h2>
  <p>
    I am extremely passionate about giving back to my community.
    I am involved in 3 different outreach programmes and it has
    taught me so much about life. They mainly focused on education
    and helping people with different backgrounds have access to
    tutoring, mentoring and interaction with girls like myself.
    One of my main motivations is the fact that i am a proud South African.
    The pride I have in my country is one of the reasons I try so hard to
    better it whether I'm working on improving education or encouraging
    people to recycle and keep our Earth clean.

  <h2>Springfield Convent Girls School</h2>
   <p>
     I absolutely love school and all the doors it has opened for me.
     During the 3 years I've spent at Springfield I've really grown as a
     person and found myself. I found out who I am as a person, what i
     value and what I want out of life. It feels asif I havent really
     lived until high school. And in the course of 3 years I've learned to
     play 2 instruments, I;ve been part of a countless number of clubs,
     I've found my passion for reading and outreach and I made incredible
     relationships that will last a lifetime.

  <h2>Code For Cape Town</h2>
   <p>
      I am extremely privileged and grateful to be a part of code4ct.
      If it wasn’t for code4ct I wouldn’t have met the amazing people that I did,
      formed the long-lasting bonds that I did and I wouldn’t have been able to code and
      discover the passion I have for coding. Coding has awakened a desire within me to
      create and change. I’ve always considered myself an uncreative person where arts and styles
      are concerned but coding has given me the opportunity to let my creative side free to explore,
      change and create. Coding has given me a whole new look on life and community. I’ve always been
      passionate about helping people but now that I’ve been taught a skill that can be so beneficial to people in need;
      I can’t help but get extra excited about coding  and all my outreach work.
