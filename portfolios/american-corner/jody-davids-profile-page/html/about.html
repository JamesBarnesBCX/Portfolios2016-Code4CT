        <p>Since I was little, I knew exactly what I wanted to become and who I wanted to be when I grow up. I planned EVERY country I will visit and at a very specific time, I had it all planned out. Code4CT changed my view on the future, especially on doing coding and IT as a future career</p>

        <p>I now want to become an Air Traffic Controller, even though I am afraid of hights, doesn't mean I can keep everyone using an aircraft safe. That is why I want to do ATC.</p>

        <p>I also do photohgraphy and designing as hobbies, but because I live on hostel at The Cape Academy of Mathematics Science And Technology, I don't really have much time to expand in these fields, although I do make time for it whenever I can. This is what I do for fun, it also keeps me busy and active and trust me, whatever I put my mind to? I make a way to make it a reality.</p>

        <p>Family and friends are my first priority, schoolwork next but it's always good to have moral support, well that's what I believe.
           Being able to do what I do takes so much support from family, especially from my parents and closest friends.</p>
