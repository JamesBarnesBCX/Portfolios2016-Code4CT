  <h1>Exam Madness</h1>
  <p>
    It’s that time of the year again. The time when everyone is suﬀering with lack of sleep
    due to the all-nighters they’ve been trying to have with nothing but a textbook to keep
    them company and the constant hole in their stomach that never seems to go away.
     IT’S THE EXAM PERIOD!
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s that time of the year when everyone is constantly “stressed-out”. The dictionary
    deﬁnition of the word stress is that it is “a state of mental or emotional strain or
    tension resulting from adverse or demanding circumstances”. Several people do not know
    how to describe the feeling of stress but the word is so overrated and overused. It's
    scientiﬁcally proven that majority of people complain more about what they have to do
    than actually doing it and all this is doing is creating a big black pit called stress
    where they all involuntarily jump into.

  <p>
    Here are three easy tips to help with the stress of exams:
  </p>
  <p>
    Stress is often caused by those around us, and as an individual we should learn that our
    emotions are not dictated by those of others.  It seems as if stress- among many others-
    are just one of those emotions that are awfully contagious. So what I strongly suggest is
    that you have absolutely no social life the day of an exam. Prevent talking to your peers
    at all cost because all that will do is carry on that unwanted feeling of stress.
  </p>
  <p>
     Have a little pep talk in the mirror. Tell yourself that you can do it because if you believe
     that you'll pass then you probably will. Having conﬁdence that you can
     do something creates an anti-stress shield around yourself because if you believe
    in something it would take a lot to convince you otherwise.
  </p>
  <p>
    And lastly- but most importantly- try your best and work hard. If you feel like you haven't
    worked hard enough chances are that you probably didn't and
     by feeling like you should've studied harder creates a huge hole for the ugly stress
     monster to jump into and consume your entire being.
