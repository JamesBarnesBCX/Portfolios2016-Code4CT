    <h1>I Hate Mondays</h1>
     <p>
        I woke to the sound of my alarm pounding mercilessly like it does every other morning.
        I used my hand as a shield to defend my poor eyes from the assault of my cellphones brightness.
        I hesitantly peeked under my hand and glared at the evil device to see the time already knowing
        that it would read: 4:30am exactly. i sprang out of bed and into the bathroom to do my daily routine.
        I rushed into the shower as I do every other morning, and scrubbed my flesh clean till it felt raw. When
        I got out of the shower the icy winter morning hit me harshly and I slid to my room in hopes of finding
        a little warmth in my happy place.
     </p>
     <p>
       I closed my bedroom door, as if that would keep all the cold air from entering my sanctuary.
       i fought to put  my clothes on, juggling the skirt in the one hand and the tie in the other.
        <i>Why on earth is there such a thing as a uniform?
       It’s not like I’m going to forget that I attend Springfield or that other people actually car what school I attend</i>,
       I thought miserably .
     </p>
     <p>
      I scurried into my parents’ room in search of my hairbrush that has mysteriously disappeared. Yeah right!
      My little brother probably recruited it as a soldier  in one of his many armies made out of nearly everything
      his sticky little hand can actually lift. If I were to accidently leave
      him in the kitchen; id be greeted by a Tupperware dish that had been used as an army tank and a tablespoon
      as the captian of the spoon army.
     </p>
     <p>
       I retrieved my brush that seemed to be lying aimlessly among many pencil crayons and cutlery.
       Its safe to say my mother hasn’t discovered his secret(or not so secret) hiding spot yet.
       <i>Oh well that’s not what I came for</i>.  I dashed into the bathroom to complete the task which was to tame the
       birds nest on the top of my head. After what seemed like an endless struggle of trying to untangle the knots
       that I’m sure are so tight it beats knots made by girl scouts that have spent months training in the art of knot-tying.
       <i>Aggg!</i>   I gave up on the impossible task of taming the beast and just pulled it up into a high bun.
       I hate Mondays but the fact that this is a Monday is the perfect excuse as to why I looked like something the cat dragged in.
     </p>
     <p>
       I peeked at the clock, fearing the numbers that the arms were pointing to. TEN TO SIX. I sprinted into my room to fetch my
       school necessities as I literally had only ten minutes to complete the rest of my morning routine. I hopped down the stairs,
       the thumps louder than those of a thunderstorm. I sat down at the breakfast table and the stench of boiled eggs did nothing
       but completely repel me from my breakfast.
       I gobbled down my breakfast regardless but taste nothing but the fact that nothing is working out for me on this terrible Monday morning.
     </p>
     <p>
       The faint revving of car coming up the road clued me into the fact that my lift was literally seconds from arriving.
       I rushed out the door for it to appear as if I’d been waiting for a while.
       When she stopped the car mere millimeters from my perfectly polished school shoes I opened the car door with so much
       grace that no one could have guessed I ran around the entire morning trying to complete my daily tasks.

       Aunty Angie drove as usual at a snail’s pace to the bus station with music which was equally or maybe even slower than her car

     </p>
     <p>
       The florescent lights that signify that we’ve arrived at the station was my saving grace from this endless
        torture of listening to old people music. I hurried out of the car in search of the bus that had the bright words
        “Wynberg Terminus” on it. I glanced at the watch that adorned my wrist and nearly passed out when I saw that it was exactly 6:03.
         I had exactly 2 minutes to find my bus before I was stranded. I picked up the speed of my frantic running quite impressively
         considering my bag weighed a ton. I swear these textbooks are made out of steel.  After what feels like hours of running when
         it’s probably been about 30 seconds I came to a complete halt right outside the bus that is supposed to transport me to my own
         personal hell. Oh joy! I made it, I thought sarcastically. I trudged up the three little steps and begrudgingly showed my bus driver
         the ticket that granted me access to that hell train or in that case hell bus . I sat down and
        contemplated the various ways in which I could commit suicide without it seeming as if I was the cause of my mysterious death. I HATE MONDAYS.
