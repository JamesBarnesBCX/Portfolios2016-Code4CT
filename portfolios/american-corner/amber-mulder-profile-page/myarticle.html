    <h1>Why Animal Abusers Should Recieve The Same Punishment As Child Abusers</h1>
    <p>
      What makes one species better than another? Is it their mental capabilities, their amount of fur or the role they play in society?
      What makes our lives as humans more important than a dog’ a cats’ or even an ant’?
      2 out of 3 cases of animal abuse is either not seen as important or the abuser gets
      something as “scary” as a fine,whereas there is a huge outcry when it’s a child abuse case.
      Now don’t get me wrong; hurting a child is one of the worst crimes but so is hurting animals.
      And the reason I can compare these two things is because it’s actually quite similar
    </p>
    <p>
    According to several behavioral measures, it’s been proven that a dog’s mental abilities are
    similar to that of a human child between the ages of 2 and 2.5 years. But that’s only dogs.
    An average calculation for an even wider range of animals is more or less 3 years old.
     Think back to when you were 3 years old.
    I know I was naughty, uncooperative and I never listened.
    This is very similar behavior to that of an untrained dog.

    <p>
      A person’s mental and physical development happens mainly in the first few years of their lives.
       What they taught and exposed to or even how they fed shapes them as a person physically and mentally.
       So if we are shaped mainly between birth and 3 years old, an animal’s entire life impacts
      their thoughts and behaviors.No wonder abused animals are so violent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Corporal punishment with children is seen as wrong and it’s illegal
      whereas people and even some veterinarians advise owners to discipline
      their dogs in such a way. In a society where we are taught that violence is never the answer its
      displayed so openly towards animals and is encouraged and accepted by most.

      In 2013 a video was released of two workers from Boswell circus viciously beating defenseless elephants.
       This year charges were dropped. Besides the fact that it took so long to finalize an obviously brutal crime;
       charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. Was a video detailing the abuse not enough? I’m sure most of
       us have seen or heard of the Ugandian nanny who violently beat an 18 month old girl after getting sick after supper.
        What makes this case different to that of the abused elephants? Besides the fact that she got 15 years and the
        elephant abusers walked free.
       Both the elephant and the girl were defenseless but one case was seen as more important that the other.
      </p>
      <p>
      Another brutal and cruel form of animal abuse is dog fighting.
      </p>
      <p>
         Michael Vick a 27 year old American quarterback, who was funding a deadly dog fighting rink,
         that was in business for over 5 years is, is another example of animal cruelty. In the 5 years that the rink was
         “in business” they have hung, drowned and beaten defenseless dogs. They killed those that did not perform well,
         starved dogs to make them vicious and beat them to break them.  They were also breeding their own kind of “vicious”
         pit-bulls. They had devices that restrained female dogs so that a male dog could viciously rape her.
         It was by sheer luck that he was caught and his cruelty was put to an end. His cousin got busted for drugs and gave Vick’s
         address as his own. Enough evidence was found that warranted a search warrant. Thank God for that.
         But even after seeing all the horrific crimes he committed he was only given a mind-boggling sentence of 12 to 18 months.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lots of people complain about how the justice system has failed them but what about those that don’t have the
         ability to complain but are being wronged the most.
         Whether animal abuse is simply being ignored or policemen are actually committing some of the crimes themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was an incident in Lotus River where a policeman carelessly shot a male dog called
         Pucko who was fiercely protecting his home along with his sister. A known burglar was trying to break into their
          home when the owners were not there but when he stepped onto the property he encountered two fiercely
          protective dogs guarding their home. Why was it okay for the policeman to kill a dog that was keeping both him
          and his sister safe? How is this incident any different from that of the 40year old man who shot intruders dead
          November 2015, or the women from Glenvista who shot 2 robbers on her property? Both cases were ruled as self-defense.
         But how was the Lotus River incident different? Was Pucko not defending himself and his sister?
      </p>
      <p>
        This article is not only about why there needs to be harsher punishment for animal abusers.
        But it’s also about why we see ourselves as superior and about why the justice system value human lives more.
         But strongly believe that if we stand together as the next generation there will be a future
         where we don’t value one life more than another. Whether it’s between people, animals or whatever
         other species there might be. I see a future where animals are not just our food, pets or entertainment.
         But our companions and equals. So let’s stand together and fight for animal rights.
