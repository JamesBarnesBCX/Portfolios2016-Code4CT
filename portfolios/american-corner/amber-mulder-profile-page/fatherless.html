    <h1>The Truth</h1>
     <p>
       The vacant lifeless chair mocked me from its position next to my mother. I stared questionably at my sister but
       she was gazing longingly at the chair with trembling lips and glossy eyes. Confused. I turned to my mother.
       She looked no better. Her tense shoulders reached her ears as she continued to struggle with her supper.
       Her eyes lacked their usual warmth and looked at me with a fake professionalism.
       A feeling of dread washed over me and I just instinctively knew: Something's coming!
     </p>
     <p>
       My hands started to tremble with anxiety and sweat began to pack up at the back of my knees.
       I felt claustrophobic. It was like the world was slowing closing in around me and
       all the oxygen was being sucked out of the air by a super vacuum. If only it could suck out all the tension too.
     </p>
     <p>
       I looked down and straight into a pair of curious black eyes gazing at my family adoringly- Storm.
       His black fur with patches of brown glistened in the light as I've just given him a bath today.
       Miranda came trotting behind him obviously jealous of all the attention he was getting.
       Miranda was my baby. I waited six weeks for her as she couldn't leave her mother yet.
       I visited her every weekend in hopes that I would finally be able to take her home that day.
     </p>
     <p>
       When I was finally able to bring her home with me there was already a fuzzy little black pup waiting for me.
       I was not at all surprised that my dad got me a dog as he always got the same ideas as me. My dad brought home
       a purebred German shepherd - Storm.
       He was beautiful. We all became fast friends and since then they've always been my source of comfort. Until now.
     </p>

       The atmosphere surrounding the table was similar to that of a funeral. All quiet, tense and
       spooky. Mom's plain white t-shirt and grey sweats was quite different from her usual Sunday best.
       My sister dressed no better. She wore what we commonly refer to as "grandma clothes". I looked straight
       ahead and saw my brother in his high chair,
       acknowledging him for the first time tonight. He lacked his usual spit - dripping smile and annoying babbles.
     </p>
     <p>
       I felt excluded. It seemed that everyone knew what was coming but me. Even my 1.5 year old brother looked prepared.
     </p>
     <p>
       "Maya!" My mother's meek call for my attention was completely pointless as she has had my undivided attention all along
     </p>
     <p>
       "Do you remember that movie we watched yesterday?" She asked
     </p>
     <p>
       I thought back to the previous day and remembered the sad animation.
      "Yes, it was really sad" I muttered."that boy didn't have a daddy. He was looking everywhere for a
      daddy but no one wanted to be his daddy!" I screamed clearly displeased. The lump lodged in
      my throat became apparent by the wavering in my voice.
     </p>
     <p>
       My mother clutched the table for dear life and my sister appeared to have
       lost all the blood flowing to her face as she looked deathly pale and resembled a sheet of blank white paper.
     </p>
     <p>
       "It was a stupid cartoon what are you crying about?" Amelia demanded.
     </p>
     <p>
       I tried to ignore her use of the word "cartoon" as I hate cartoons. They're for children and I'm a big girl. <i>It's an animation</i> I thought.
     </p>
     <p>
       "Yes,he was looking for someone to be his father but do you remember what he said at the end?" My mother asked hopefully.
     </p>
     <p>
       "He said that he didn't need a daddy anymore because he had his mommy" I stated proudly
     </p>
     <p>
       "That's right". I could see a smile slowing creeping onto her face. It's the first one I've seen in days. My chest swelled with pride.
        I would do anything to make her smile again. Even give up Mr Cuddles like she has tried so often to coax me into doing.
     </p>
     <p>
       "But I'm very glad that I have a mommy and a daddy" I stated. Beaming proudly
     </p>
     <p>
       "This is stupid!" Amelia exclaimed. She jumped out of her chair and stalked off in the direction of the staircase.
        Her reaction confused me but my daddy told me that Ameliaâ€™s at that time in her life when she'll be acting very strangely.
     </p>
     <p>
       "Mommy, what's wrong with Amelia?"
     </p>
     <p>
       "She's upset sweetie"
     </p>
     <p>
       "But why? Everyone looks sad but I don't understand"
     </p>
     <p>
       "Maya, your daddy and I have been thinking that perhaps it would be better if we go our separate ways for a while" she said gently.
     </p>
     <p>
       "I don't understand" I whined."Where's my daddy!" I demanded already knowing and dreading the answer.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Not here" her answer was solemn and final.
     </p>
