          <h2>How I Plan To Make A Difference</h2>
           <article>
            <div class="article-content" id="articleContent">
              <p>I plan on making a difference by using my current knowledge and what I have learnt through this year to help
                people and I believe coding can help me achieve this. I don't exactly know I plan to do this yet but I have my
                whole life ahead of me to figure that one out. Hopefully with the skills I have learnt through Code4CT I will
                be able to do what I enjoy the most and get paid for it.</p>

              <h3> Code4CT </h3>

              <p> I was introduced to Code4CT at school by one of my teachers. She explained what the program was about and that
                 there were only a limited numder of spaces. I thought that it would be a really awesome opportunity but I first
                 had to discuss it with my parents. One of my friends said she signed up for it and so I said to myself "Just try
                it. Maybe you will actually learn something that could benefit you in the future" and luckily there was one more
                space available. That fisrt day of Code Week I had no idea what coding was and I was completely clueless. However
                after that first week our skills were tested and I am proud to say that what we created was a success. This program
               has taught me so much in so little time it's pretty amazing.</p>

              <p>There have been so many people who came to speak to us about their careers in tech and how they are making a difference
                 in so many people's lives. All those speakers really inspired me to actually consider pursuing a career in tech someday.
                 I think what Code4CT is doing is amazing, educating young women about coding which is a male dominated field, empowering
                 women to be anything they want to and showing them that they can be as good as men at everything they do. I will be forever
                grateful to my teacher Dani and to all the tutors who helped us when we were a little unsure of ourselves.</p>
