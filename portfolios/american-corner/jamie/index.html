      <h1 class="heading-style">My code journey </h1>
        <p> I first heard about Code4ct when Emma and Andrea came
          to my school to tell us about it. They told us what coding was about
          as well as how we could use this skill to help others.
      The talk was incredibly inspiring and it motivated me to
            join this wonderful programme.</p>
        <p>In the past few months I have learnt many incredible skills.
          We have also been given a nu,ber of  wonderful opportunies to
          attend outside events such as Hackathns, Techtalks and Girl Geek Dinners </p>
