      <div class="article-content" id="articleContent">


      <p>With the skills I have learnt from Code4ct, there are many things I can do to make a difference in the world.  I'll have to take it one step at a time,
        because for me to be able to run, I've got to learn how to walk.  I started at crawling, to baby steps, to walking and finally with the help of Code4ct I'm on my way to running.</p>

      <p>Some communities have safty problem. People get robed on a daily basis. Now imagine having an app that is sutable for all moblie phones, from a Nokia68 to an iPhone6. This app will be
      conected to anyone -in that specific community including that communities police department - that has the app. How it will function is that the user will choose a specific botton
    </p>
    <p>eg.</p>
    <p> For mobile phones with bottons it's opptional</p>
    <p> For touch screen mobile phones the lock botton or the volume botton</p>

    <p>  to press and hold for a specific amount of seconds that alerts the community members and the police that you are being robed. From  there a community member or the police will press
      track botton that will track your mobile phone. With the tracker on the police can easily track your mobile phone and find the rober though your mobile phone. That way we would be
      reducing the danger and fear of walking in your community.

      <h2><a>My Code Camp App</a></h2>

      <p>During Code Camp, me and 15 other girls, meet up with an organisaion call Femme, standing for 'Freedom of Education Motivates Empowerment'. What this Oganisation does, is that it goes

        to different places around South Africa, teaching young girls about the mestruaton cycle.</p>


      <p>We made an app called 'Big Sista'. What this app does is that it informs the app user about the different cycles of menstruation, it informs them about the vigina and what happens in

        vigina during menstruation. It also informs the user about the different senitory products and tips about how to make your period less painfull. The app consists of a menstruation

        calculator, which calculates which menstruation cycle your on and will remind the user when their next period starts.
      </p>


      <p>The app also consists of a quiz, where by the user  can test how how much they know about menstruation. If you get any of the questions incorrect the app will provide you with a link

      that will have all the information about that spesific question/s that you got wrong.</p>


      <p>To make the users feel more comfortable with the app, we made the app available in English, Afrikaans and in IsiXhosa.</p>
